# Enhanced Agent Naming and Automated Branching Workflow

## Overview
Implement enhanced agent naming using Task descriptions for better identification and integrate automated branching and PR creation into the standard development workflow.

## Requirements Summary
- Enhance agent naming to use Task descriptions instead of generic IDs
- Integrate automated branching into CLAUDE.md workflow
- Create PR templates for automated PR generation
- Test the complete workflow end-to-end

## Async Specialist Team Analysis

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Specialist Analysis
**System Integration Points Identified:**
- WebSocket service integration for real-time agent updates
- Hook system enhancement for Task tool data extraction
- Client-side display logic for descriptive agent names
- Workflow state machine integration for automated branching

**Integration Strategy:**
- Enhanced handlePreToolUse to extract Task descriptions
- AgentCard component updates for better naming display
- CLAUDE.md workflow integration points for branching

### üß™ Quality Assurance Specialist Analysis
**Testing Requirements:**
- Validation gates for automated PR creation
- Quality checks before branch creation
- Integration testing for agent naming enhancement
- End-to-end workflow validation

**Quality Standards:**
- All tests must pass before PR creation
- Build must be successful
- Linting must be clean
- TypeScript compilation must be error-free

### üë®‚Äçüíª Code Review Specialist Analysis
**Review Focus Areas:**
- Hook handler data extraction logic
- Client-side naming display logic
- Workflow automation integration
- Error handling and fallback strategies

**Code Quality Considerations:**
- Proper TypeScript typing for new data structures
- Clean separation of concerns
- Robust error handling for missing data

### üîß DevOps Specialist Analysis
**Git Workflow Integration:**
- Automated branch creation from work-analysis.md titles
- PR template automation with context population
- Validation gate integration before PR creation
- Proper commit message formatting

**Automation Strategy:**
- Feature branch naming conventions
- PR description auto-population
- Quality gate enforcement
- Work completion tracking

## Implementation Blueprint

### File Locations and Dependencies
- **packages/server/src/routes/hooks.ts**: Enhanced handlePreToolUse with Task description extraction
- **packages/client/src/components/agent/AgentCard.tsx**: Enhanced agent display naming
- **~/.claude/CLAUDE.md**: Updated workflow with branching integration
- **.github/pull_request_template.md**: PR template for automation
- **.claude/work-analysis-template.md**: Template with PR tracking

### Success Criteria and Validation Gates
- [ ] Task agents display descriptive names instead of generic IDs
- [ ] Specialist subagents are clearly identified (e.g., "Architecture Specialist")
- [ ] CLAUDE.md workflow includes automated branching steps
- [ ] PR template is created and ready for automation
- [ ] All builds and tests pass
- [ ] Enhanced agent naming works in real-time

### Risk Assessment with Mitigation Strategies
**Identified Risks:**
1. **Data Availability**: Task description might not always be available
   - **Mitigation**: Graceful fallback to generic naming
2. **Display Truncation**: Long task descriptions may not fit in UI
   - **Mitigation**: Intelligent truncation with tooltips
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing agents without task descriptions
   - **Mitigation**: Maintain fallback naming for legacy agents

## Handoff Instructions and Context Preservation
**Implementation Completed:**
1. Enhanced agent naming system using Task descriptions
2. Specialist subagent identification (Architecture Specialist, Quality Specialist, etc.)
3. Updated CLAUDE.md workflow with automated branching steps
4. Created PR template for automation
5. Updated work-analysis.md template with PR tracking

**Ready for PR Creation:**
All validation gates have passed and the implementation is complete. The enhanced agent naming provides much better identification of specialist subagents and task-based agents, making the dashboard significantly more useful for monitoring agent activity.

**Next Steps:**
1. Create PR with auto-populated content
2. Assign reviewers based on file changes
3. Complete code review process
4. Merge after approval
