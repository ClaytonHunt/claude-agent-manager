# Execute Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

Execute the implementation plan created by `/generate-prp` using Test-Driven Development cycles with async specialist oversight.

## Context
This command executes the comprehensive work analysis and implementation plan from `work-analysis.md`, using the Agentic Development Methodology with continuous specialist guidance throughout the development process.

## Prerequisites
- Existing `.claude/work-analysis.md` (created by `/generate-prp`)
- If work-analysis.md doesn't exist, prompt user to run `/generate-prp` first
- Feature specification in `.claude/feature.md` or `.claude/prd.md`

## Process

### 1. Load and Validate Work Analysis
Read and parse the existing work analysis:
- Load `.claude/work-analysis.md`
- Validate implementation plan completeness
- Extract phase breakdown and success criteria
- Identify file locations and dependencies

### 2. Launch Async Specialist Oversight Team
Execute continuous specialist monitoring throughout implementation:

```
Task: Architecture specialist - monitor implementation for architectural compliance and design pattern adherence
Task: Quality assurance specialist - oversee TDD implementation and test coverage validation
Task: Code review specialist - review code quality and provide optimization recommendations
Task: Security specialist - validate security implementation and identify vulnerabilities
Task: Performance specialist - monitor performance implications and optimization opportunities
```

### 3. Initialize Implementation Environment
Prepare the development environment:

#### Git Workflow Setup
- Create feature branch with descriptive name based on work analysis
- Ensure clean working directory
- Set up branch protection and validation hooks

#### Validation Environment
- Verify test framework is configured
- Validate build pipeline is working
- Ensure lint and typecheck commands are available
- Confirm pre-commit hooks are installed

### 4. Execute Phased Implementation

#### Phase Execution Pattern
For each phase in the work analysis:

1. **Phase Initialization**
   - Mark phase as in_progress in TodoWrite
   - Review phase objectives and deliverables
   - Validate prerequisites are met
   - Set up phase-specific validation criteria

2. **TDD Cycle Implementation**
   - Follow strict RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycles
   - Write tests first based on acceptance criteria
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactor for quality while keeping tests passing

3. **Specialist Validation Checkpoints**
   - Architecture review at each major component
   - Security validation for sensitive operations
   - Performance assessment for critical paths
   - Code quality review before phase completion

4. **Phase Completion**
   - Run full test suite with 10-minute timeout
   - Execute build validation
   - Run lint and typecheck validation
   - Mark phase as completed in TodoWrite

### 5. TDD Implementation Protocol

#### RED Phase - Write Failing Tests
```
1. Extract acceptance criteria from work analysis
2. Write test cases that validate acceptance criteria
3. Ensure tests fail (confirming test validity)
4. Commit failing tests with descriptive message
```

#### GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation
```
1. Write minimal code to make tests pass
2. Focus on functionality, not optimization
3. Validate all tests pass
4. Commit working implementation
```

#### REFACTOR Phase - Quality Enhancement
```
1. Improve code quality while keeping tests passing
2. Apply design patterns and best practices
3. Optimize performance based on specialist feedback
4. Validate tests still pass after refactoring
5. Commit refactored code
```

### 6. Specialist Integration Points

#### Architecture Specialist Oversight
- **Component Design**: Validate architectural patterns and dependencies
- **System Integration**: Ensure proper integration points and data flow
- **Scalability Review**: Assess implementation for future scalability
- **Technical Debt**: Identify and address potential technical debt

#### Quality Assurance Specialist Oversight
- **Test Coverage**: Monitor and validate test coverage targets
- **Test Quality**: Review test design and edge case coverage
- **Automation Strategy**: Ensure automated testing pipeline
- **Quality Gates**: Validate quality checkpoints are met

#### Security Specialist Oversight
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Continuous security review during implementation
- **Data Protection**: Validate encryption and data handling practices
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Review access control implementation
- **Compliance Validation**: Ensure regulatory compliance requirements

#### Performance Specialist Oversight
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Monitor performance against targets
- **Resource Optimization**: Identify optimization opportunities
- **Monitoring Integration**: Implement performance tracking
- **Scalability Testing**: Validate performance under load

#### Code Review Specialist Oversight
- **Code Quality Standards**: Enforce coding conventions and best practices
- **Maintainability**: Ensure code is maintainable and well-documented
- **Performance Optimization**: Review code-level performance considerations
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Document decisions and implementation details

### 7. Continuous Validation Gates

#### Per-Commit Validation
- All tests pass (`npm run test:all` with 10min timeout)
- Build succeeds (`npm run build` with 10min timeout)
- Lint passes (`npm run lint`)
- Type checking passes (`npm run typecheck`)

#### Phase Completion Validation
- All phase deliverables completed
- Specialist sign-off received
- Performance benchmarks met
- Security review passed

#### Final Implementation Validation
- Complete end-to-end testing
- Full system integration testing
- Performance validation under realistic load
- Security penetration testing
- Documentation completeness review
