# Generate Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

Create a comprehensive implementation plan from a Product Requirements Document or feature specification using the Agentic Development Methodology.

## Context
This command transforms high-level requirements (PRD or feature.md) into detailed implementation plans with specialist analysis. It creates a comprehensive work-analysis.md that serves as the blueprint for development execution using async specialist subagents.

## Prerequisites
- Existing `.claude/prd.md` OR `.claude/feature.md`
- If neither exists, prompt user to run `/create-prd` or `/feature-from-github-issue` first

## Process

### 1. Input Source Detection
Check for existing requirements documents in priority order:
1. `.claude/feature.md` - Feature specification (highest priority)
2. `.claude/prd.md` - Product Requirements Document
3. User-specified file path

If no source found, guide user to create requirements first.

### 2. Launch Async Specialist Subagents
Execute comprehensive parallel analysis with all relevant specialists:

```
Task: Architecture specialist - analyze system design requirements, integration points, and technical architecture for the feature/product requirements
Task: Frontend specialist - design UI/UX approach, component architecture, and user interface requirements
Task: Backend specialist - plan API design, data architecture, and server-side implementation approach
Task: Quality assurance specialist - develop comprehensive testing strategy, test automation, and quality gates
Task: Security specialist - conduct threat assessment, identify security requirements, and define security implementation
Task: Performance specialist - analyze performance requirements, optimization opportunities, and scalability considerations
Task: DevOps specialist - plan deployment strategy, CI/CD integration, and infrastructure requirements
Task: Code review specialist - establish code quality standards, review processes, and implementation best practices
```

### 3. Requirements Analysis
Parse and analyze the source document:

#### Extract Core Elements
- **Objective**: Primary goal and business value
- **Scope**: Feature boundaries and deliverables
- **User Stories**: Primary user workflows and personas
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Testable success conditions
- **Technical Requirements**: System constraints and integrations
- **Dependencies**: External systems and prerequisites

#### Identify Complexity Factors
- **Technical Complexity**: New technologies, integrations, architectural changes
- **Business Complexity**: Complex business logic, multiple user types, workflow variations
- **Integration Complexity**: External APIs, data migrations, system interactions
- **UI/UX Complexity**: New patterns, responsive design, accessibility requirements

### 4. Consolidate Specialist Findings
Wait for all specialist analyses to complete, then synthesize findings:

#### Architecture Assessment
- System design approach and patterns
- Integration points and dependencies
- Scalability and maintainability considerations
- Technology choices and architectural decisions

#### Implementation Strategy
- Development approach and methodology
- Phase breakdown and milestone planning
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Resource requirements and timeline estimates

#### Quality Framework
- Testing strategy and automation approach
- Code review standards and processes
- Performance benchmarks and monitoring
- Security implementation and validation

### 5. Generate Comprehensive Work Analysis
Create detailed `work-analysis.md` with specialist insights:

```markdown
