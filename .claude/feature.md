# Feature Specification: Agent Detail Pages

## Feature Overview
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Business Value**: Critical for user debugging and agent management  
**User Impact**: Essential for effective agent monitoring and troubleshooting  
**GitHub Issue**: Next roadmap priority (Agent cards currently show "TODO: Navigate to detail")

## Problem Statement
Currently, users cannot drill down into individual agent details for debugging. Agent cards on the dashboard show basic information but navigate to "TODO: Navigate to agent detail" instead of providing comprehensive agent views. This significantly limits users' ability to effectively debug agent issues, view detailed logs, monitor performance, and understand agent context.

## User Stories

### Primary User Story
**As a developer monitoring Claude Code agents**, I need detailed agent views so that I can effectively debug issues, monitor performance, and understand agent behavior in real-time.

### Supporting User Stories
1. **As a developer**, I want to click on an agent card and see comprehensive agent details including full context, logs, and metadata
2. **As a developer**, I want to see real-time tool execution timelines to understand what an agent is currently doing
3. **As a developer**, I want to view agent performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
4. **As a developer**, I want to see detailed error information and stack traces when agents encounter issues
5. **As a developer**, I want to perform actions on agents (restart, pause, handoff) from the detail view

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Agent cards navigate to individual agent detail pages (`/agents/:id`)
- [ ] Agent detail page displays comprehensive agent information
- [ ] Real-time updates via WebSocket for live agent monitoring
- [ ] Responsive design for desktop and mobile access
- [ ] Error handling for non-existent or deleted agents

### Agent Detail Page Components
- [ ] **Agent Overview**: Status, project, creation time, last activity
- [ ] **Agent Metrics**: Performance statistics, tool usage, execution times
- [ ] **Agent Logs**: Filterable, searchable log viewer with infinite scroll
- [ ] **Agent Context**: JSON viewer for agent context and metadata
- [ ] **Agent Actions**: Buttons for restart, pause, handoff, delete operations
- [ ] **Tool Timeline**: Chronological view of tool executions with status

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] React Router integration for `/agents/:id` routes
- [ ] API endpoint for individual agent details (`GET /api/agents/:id`)
- [ ] WebSocket integration for real-time agent updates
- [ ] Loading states and skeleton loaders
- [ ] Error boundaries for component failure handling
- [ ] Performance optimization for large log datasets

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Navigation and Basic Detail View
1. **React Router Setup**: Configure `/agents/:id` routes
2. **Basic Detail Page**: Create `AgentDetailPage` component
3. **Navigation Fix**: Update `AgentCard` to navigate to detail page
4. **API Enhancement**: Extend backend for agent details

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Detail Components
1. **Agent Overview Component**: Status, metadata, basic information
2. **Agent Metrics Component**: Performance statistics and charts
3. **Agent Logs Component**: Advanced log viewer with filtering
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Agent Actions**: Operational buttons (restart, pause, etc.)
2. **Tool Timeline**: Chronological view of agent tool usage
3. **Agent Context Viewer**: JSON inspector for agent data
4. **Performance Optimization**: Virtual scrolling, lazy loading

## TDD Implementation Strategy

### RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycles
1. **🔴 RED**: Write test for agent detail page routing
2. **🟢 GREEN**: Implement basic agent detail page and routing
3. **♻️ REFACTOR**: Extract reusable components and optimize

### Incremental Checkpoints
1. **Checkpoint 1**: Agent detail routing works
2. **Checkpoint 2**: Basic agent information displays
3. **Checkpoint 3**: Real-time updates working
4. **Checkpoint 4**: Complete agent detail functionality
