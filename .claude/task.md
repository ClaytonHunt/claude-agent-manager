# Current Task: Phase 1.1 - Clean Up Agentic Base Package

## CURRENT TASK
**Task**: Remove all business logic from agentic-base to transform it into a pure starter kit  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours  
**GitHub Issue**: https://github.com/ClaytonHunt/claude-agent-manager/issues/1
**Parent Feature**: Architectural Realignment & Feature Completion

## SPECIALIST ANALYSIS

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Reviewer
**Scope**: Transform agentic-base from application to pure starter kit
**Recommendations**: 
- Remove ALL business logic - CLI tools, client libraries, hook managers
- Keep only templates, setup files, and documentation
- Ensure zero dependencies on business logic packages
**Files to Review**: 
- packages/agentic-base/src/: All business logic files to be deleted
- packages/agentic-base/package.json: Remove application dependencies

### üß™ Quality Engineer
**Testing Approach**: Verify removal doesn't break existing functionality
**Test Files**: 
- No tests needed for deletion, but verify build still works
**Coverage Target**: N/A for deletion task

### üë®‚Äçüíª Senior Developer
**Implementation Notes**: Clean deletion with proper dependency cleanup
**Patterns to Use**: 
- Verify no other packages depend on deleted code
- Clean package.json of unused dependencies
**Code Review Focus**: 
- Complete removal of business logic
- Proper dependency cleanup

### üîß DevOps Engineer
**Build Impact**: Remove packages from build pipeline temporarily
**Environment Considerations**: Build should still work after cleanup
**Dependencies**: Remove CLI and client library dependencies

### üé® Design Reviewer
**UI/UX Impact**: No UI impact for this cleanup task
**Accessibility**: N/A
**Design Consistency**: N/A

### üìã Product Owner
**Business Logic**: Remove application logic to create true starter kit
**User Impact**: Sets foundation for proper starter kit templates
**Acceptance Criteria**: 
- [ ] All CLI tools deleted (feature-from-github-issue.ts)
- [ ] All client libraries deleted (AgentManagerClient.ts)
- [ ] All hook managers deleted (ClaudeCodeHookManager.ts)
- [ ] Package size reduced from 734 lines to ~50 lines
- [ ] Only template files and setup utilities remain

## IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH

### TDD Cycle 1: Analyze Current Structure
**Focus**: Understand what needs to be deleted
- [ ] **RED**: Document current structure and dependencies
- [ ] **GREEN**: Create deletion plan
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Verify plan is complete

### TDD Cycle 2: Remove Business Logic Files
**Focus**: Delete all application code
- [ ] **RED**: Verify files exist before deletion
- [ ] **GREEN**: Delete CLI tools, client libraries, hook managers
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Clean up empty directories

### TDD Cycle 3: Clean Dependencies
**Focus**: Remove unused dependencies from package.json
- [ ] **RED**: Identify unused dependencies
- [ ] **GREEN**: Remove unused dependencies
- [ ] **REFACTOR**: Verify build still works

## FILE CHANGES

**Files to Delete**:
- packages/agentic-base/src/cli/feature-from-github-issue.ts: CLI tool (331 lines)
- packages/agentic-base/src/utils/agent-manager-client.ts: Client library (231 lines)
- packages/agentic-base/src/hooks/claude-code-hooks.ts: Hook manager (172 lines)
- packages/agentic-base/src/cli/: Entire CLI directory
- packages/agentic-base/.claude/commands/feature-from-github-issue.md: Incorrectly placed command

**Files to Modify**:
- packages/agentic-base/package.json: Remove CLI and client dependencies
- packages/agentic-base/src/index.ts: Remove exports of deleted modules

**Files to Keep**:
- packages/agentic-base/README.md: Will be updated in Phase 1.2
- packages/agentic-base/package.json: Structure kept, dependencies cleaned

## VALIDATION

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Build succeeds after deletion
- [ ] No broken imports remain
- [ ] Package.json is valid
- [ ] Workspace configuration still works

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Root build command works
- [ ] Other packages not affected
- [ ] Monorepo structure intact

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Can navigate to agentic-base directory
- [ ] Package structure is clean
- [ ] No business logic remains

## DEPENDENCIES

**Blocked By**: None (first task in sequence)

**Blocks**: 
- Phase 1.2: Create agentic-base starter kit templates
- Phase 1.3: Remove incorrect CLI package

**External Dependencies**: 
- None for deletion task

## CONTEXT FOR NEXT DEVELOPER

### Key Decisions Made
- Complete removal of business logic to create pure starter kit
- Preserving package structure for template creation in Phase 1.2
- Clean dependency removal to avoid build issues

### Gotchas to Watch For
- Don't delete package.json entirely - just clean dependencies
- Verify no other packages import from deleted modules
- Keep directory structure for template creation

### Resources
- Work Analysis: .claude/work-analysis.md (corrected architectural context)
- GitHub Issue: https://github.com/ClaytonHunt/claude-agent-manager/issues/1
- Current agentic-base: packages/agentic-base/src/ (to be cleaned)
