# Dashboard UI Fixes and Agent Display Issues

## Overview
**Objective**: Fix Dashboard UI issues and agent display problems in the Claude Agent Manager
**Complexity**: Medium (UI fixes + backend event handling)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours

## Requirements Summary
1. **Remove Dashboard Real-time Connected Indicator**: Eliminate confusion by removing duplicate connected indicator from dashboard (keep header one)
2. **Fix Agent Auto-display**: Investigate and fix why new agents/subagents aren't automatically appearing on Dashboard
3. **Fix Hook Warning**: Resolve `[WARN] Unknown Claude Code hook type: subagent_stop` issue

## Async Specialist Analysis Summary

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Specialist Findings
**System Design Analysis**: 
- Dashboard and header have duplicate connection indicators causing UX confusion
- Agent display system relies on real-time events from WebSocket connections
- Hook system needs proper event type handling for all agent lifecycle events

**Integration Points**: 
- WebSocket event handling between server and client
- Real-time updates for agent status and lifecycle
- Hook system integration with Claude Code

**Technical Dependencies**: 
- WebSocket connection management
- Agent lifecycle event system
- Hook type registration and handling

### üé® Frontend Specialist Findings
**UI/UX Issues**:
- Duplicate connection indicators create user confusion
- Dashboard should focus on agent management, not connection status
- Missing real-time updates for new agent display

**Component Architecture**:
- Dashboard component needs agent list auto-refresh
- Connection status should be centralized in header only
- Agent display components need proper event listeners

### üóÑÔ∏è Backend Specialist Findings
**API and Event System**:
- WebSocket events for agent lifecycle need proper handling
- Hook system missing `subagent_stop` event type registration
- Agent creation/deletion events may not be properly propagated

**Data Architecture**:
- Agent state management across WebSocket connections
- Event broadcasting to all connected clients
- Hook event type validation and processing

### üß™ Quality Assurance Specialist Findings
**Testing Strategy**:
- Test agent creation/deletion with real-time updates
- Verify connection indicator behavior
- Test hook event handling for all agent lifecycle events

**Edge Cases**:
- Network disconnection/reconnection scenarios
- Multiple agent creation in rapid succession
- Hook system error handling

### üîí Security Specialist Findings
**Security Considerations**:
- WebSocket message validation
- Agent data sanitization
- Hook event authorization

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Investigation and Analysis
**Objective**: Understand current state and identify root causes
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Analyze Dashboard component structure
- [ ] Identify real-time connection indicator code
- [ ] Trace agent display update mechanism
- [ ] Review hook system event handling

### Phase 2: Fix Dashboard Connection Indicator
**Objective**: Remove duplicate connection indicator
**Duration**: 15-30 minutes
**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Remove Dashboard connection indicator component
- [ ] Verify header connection indicator still works
- [ ] Test UI changes

### Phase 3: Fix Agent Auto-display
**Objective**: Ensure new agents appear automatically
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes
**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Fix WebSocket event handling for agent creation
- [ ] Ensure proper event broadcasting
- [ ] Test agent display updates

### Phase 4: Fix Hook Warning
**Objective**: Resolve subagent_stop hook type warning
**Duration**: 30-45 minutes
**Key Deliverables**:
- [ ] Add subagent_stop to hook type registry
- [ ] Implement proper event handling
- [ ] Test hook system integration

## File Locations and Dependencies

### Frontend Files
- Dashboard component: Likely in client/src/components/Dashboard
- Connection indicator: Dashboard and header components
- Agent display: Dashboard agent list components

### Backend Files
- WebSocket handling: Server WebSocket event handlers
- Hook system: Hook type registration and event processing
- Agent lifecycle: Agent creation/deletion event emission

### Hook System Files
- Hook type definitions and registration
- Event processing and validation
- Claude Code integration

## Success Criteria and Validation Gates

### Technical Validation
- [ ] Dashboard connection indicator removed successfully
- [ ] Header connection indicator still functional
- [ ] New agents appear automatically on Dashboard
- [ ] Subagent_stop hook warning resolved
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved

### User Experience Validation
- [ ] No UI confusion from duplicate indicators
- [ ] Real-time agent updates working
- [ ] Dashboard provides clear agent management
- [ ] No console warnings or errors

### Integration Validation
- [ ] WebSocket events properly handled
- [ ] Hook system processes all event types
- [ ] Agent lifecycle events broadcast correctly

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
- **WebSocket Event Handling**: Changes could break real-time updates
- **Agent State Management**: Improper event handling could cause state inconsistencies
- **Hook System Integration**: Changes could break Claude Code integration

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Changes**: Fix one issue at a time with validation
- **Backup Event Handling**: Ensure existing event handlers remain functional
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all agent lifecycle scenarios

## TDD Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation Testing
1. **RED**: Write tests for Dashboard without connection indicator
2. **GREEN**: Remove connection indicator from Dashboard
3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up related styling and components

### Phase 2: Agent Display Testing
1. **RED**: Write tests for automatic agent display updates
2. **GREEN**: Implement proper event handling for agent updates
3. **REFACTOR**: Optimize event handling and state management

### Phase 3: Hook System Testing
1. **RED**: Write tests for subagent_stop hook type handling
2. **GREEN**: Add subagent_stop to hook type registry
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve hook system error handling
