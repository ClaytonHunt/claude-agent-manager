# Feature: Claude Agent Manager System

## FEATURE:
Create a comprehensive monitoring and management system for Claude Code agents and subagents with two main components:
1. An agentic base layer that can be used to start any project
2. An agent management tool that monitors and manages currently running agents

The system should incorporate examples from `./claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability` and `./context-engineering-intro` projects, combining autonomous context-based engineering patterns for rapid development.

## BUSINESS VALUE:
- **Developer Productivity**: Enable autonomous development through intelligent agent orchestration
- **System Observability**: Provide real-time visibility into agent activities and status
- **Context Preservation**: Maintain agent histories and context for seamless handoffs
- **Rapid Development**: Accelerate project development through reusable agentic patterns
- **Work Management**: Automate GitHub issue triage and task prioritization

## USER STORY:
As a developer using Claude Code, I want a centralized system to monitor and manage all my Claude Code agents and subagents, so that I can understand their activities, track their progress, and ensure successful completion of development tasks.

## REQUIREMENTS:

### Core Components:
1. **Agentic Base Layer**
   - Reusable foundation for any project
   - Lives at the top level of each application
   - Incorporates context engineering patterns
   - Enables autonomous development workflows

2. **Management & Monitoring Tool**
   - Runs as a singleton instance for the environment
   - Local service (preferably daemon)
   - Real-time agent tracking and status updates
   - Log aggregation and viewing
   - Agent history retention until dismissed

### Technical Requirements:
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript, Express or Fastify
- **Frontend**: React with rsbuild (not Vite)
- **State Management**: Redis with configurable retention policies
- **Communication**: WebSockets for real-time updates
- **Integration**: Claude Code hooks and webhooks

### Communication Architecture:
- Claude Code hooks for agent event capture
- Webhooks for server-to-application updates
- API or alternative method for agent-to-server communication
- Stretch goal: Two-way communication enabling web app to spin up Claude Code instances

### GitHub Integration:
- Create new `feature-from-github-issue` command
- Pull issues from current project repository
- Automated issue triage based on business value and effort
- Leave triage notes/tags in issues
- Skip already-triaged issues
- Select highest value, lowest effort issues for development

### Agent Collaboration:
- Async subagents act as a team
- Leave appropriate context for other team members
- Tag-team approach for continuous work
- MVP condition must be satisfied before work stops
- High code quality and passing unit tests required

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- [ ] Agentic base layer can be installed in any project
- [ ] Management tool runs as singleton instance
- [ ] Real-time agent registration and status monitoring
- [ ] Log aggregation and viewing functionality
- [ ] Agent histories retained until user dismissal
- [ ] Claude Code hooks integration working
- [ ] WebSocket communication established
- [ ] GitHub issue triage automation functional
- [ ] Subagents can handoff work with context preservation
- [ ] MVP includes high code quality and passing tests

## TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Redis retention policies must support indefinite storage until user dismissal
- Consider TTL with refresh on access for efficient memory usage
- Daemon process management for consistent availability
- Port/domain strategy for local service access
- WebSocket connection resilience and reconnection logic
- Security considerations for agent authentication

## EXAMPLES:
- Reference: `./claude-code-hooks-multi-agent-observability` for multi-agent development patterns
- Reference: `./context-engineering-intro` for context engineering patterns
- User-level commands for extended context engineering concepts

## DOCUMENTATION:
- Claude Code documentation for current features and usage
- Claude Code hooks and webhooks API reference
- Context engineering patterns and best practices
- GitHub API for issue management

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:
- **MVP Focus**: Prioritize monitoring capabilities (registration, status, logs)
- **Post-MVP**: Agent lifecycle management, performance metrics
- **Stretch Goals**: Two-way communication, web-based agent instantiation
- **Performance**: Choose technologies balancing performance and development speed
- **Scalability**: Design for future distributed deployment options
